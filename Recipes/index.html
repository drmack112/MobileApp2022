    <h1>GF Flourless Peanut Butter Cookies</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of egg whites</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>Sugar for sprinkling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and place the racks in the upper and lower third of the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, mix the peanut butter, sugar, nutmeg, vanilla and egg white until well combined. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the mixture about 1 inch apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Flatten the mounds with the tines of a fork, making a crosshatch pattern on the cookies. Sprinkle sugar on top of the cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake until golden around the edges, about 10 minutes, switching the position of the sheets halfway through baking. Transfer to racks to cool. Repeat with the remaining dough. Sprinkle more sugar.

Place water in mixing bowl.
In a separate bowl, mix salt and yeast (and sugar if using) into flour
Combine flour/salt/yeast mixture into water and mix until all the flour has been incorporated.
After flour has been totally incorporated, add oil and knead for about 4 to 5 minutes (see note)
Test final dough temperature, which should ideally be between high 70s to low 80s (optional)
Diving the dough and letting it rise
Divide dough into 4 equal pieces (using a digital scale if possible; each ball should weigh 11.5 oz [~326 grams]), shape into a ball, and place in greased, sealed quart-sized container or oiled/greased freezer bag and refrigerate overnight or up to 72 hours (After much experimenting, I have concluded that I like 3 days best but day 2 is good too).
Assembling and baking the pizzas
The following day, remove your dough balls within 1 hour or less of baking and allow the dough to come to room temperature. (the dough will tend to blister more if the dough has not been allowed to come to room temperature however, I often bake coldish dough without problems, just some bubbling)
In the meantime, place your pizza stone in oven and preheat at 550 degrees (depending on thickness of your stone and your ovenâ€™s power) for at least 1 hour
Open each dough ball using care not to degas, transfer to a pre-floured pizza peel (or on parchment paper), and top with your favorite sauce, cheese, or other toppings.
Transfer pizza from peel to oven or slide parchment paper onto preheated pizza pan/stone and bake for 4 to 6 minutes each until browned on top and cheese has melted but not burned.
Enjoy!
